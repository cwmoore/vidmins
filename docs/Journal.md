Started journal in this document. (Backfill earlier-development content.)
Worked today on editing existing notes. Created servlet EditNote.java for the task,
updated note.jsp and watcher.jsp, NoteDatajava, and NewNote.java.
Refactored session-stored data access objects to load in method loadHelpers(), though
might have been easier to wait to use Hibernate.
