# Video Minutes

This is an app for any video viewers who want to mark sections to review.

It runs in the browser alongside YouTube's video player and lets you add content linked to specific points in a video timeline.
By both creating notes, and having searchable access to cued up lecture topics, the student can engage with topics over time.
